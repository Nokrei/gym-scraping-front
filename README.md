Frontend of this app doesn't have anything spectacular in it:

Using fetch API to get data from backend, storing it in a state variable (state.data), then sorting by price (const compare). Some regex to shorten the sites' names (const r)
and conditional rendering to display progress loader (<CircularProgress/>) or data. A bit of styling with Material UI and inline CSS and one line in an external CSS file for hover effect (.gymName:hover).
